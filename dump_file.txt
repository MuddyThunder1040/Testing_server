# Dumps Information

A "dump" typically refers to a file or output that contains a snapshot of data from a system, database, or application. Dumps are often used for debugging, backup, or data migration purposes.

## Common Types of Dumps

1. **Database Dump**: A file containing the contents of a database, usually in SQL or binary format.
2. **Memory Dump**: A snapshot of the contents of a computer's memory at a specific time, often used for debugging crashes.
3. **Log Dump**: A collection of log entries exported from an application or system.

## Example Usage

- Creating a database dump:
    ```
    mysqldump -u username -p database_name > dump_file.sql
    ```
- Analyzing a memory dump with debugging tools.

## Note

Always handle dump files with care, as they may contain sensitive information.
